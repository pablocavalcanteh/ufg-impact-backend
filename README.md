# UFG Impacto Backend

This is a project built up with Spring Framework and other technologies.
It's been developed using **Hexagonal Architecture** as a base in order to isolate the business domain from the Spring Framework,
facilitating an eventual exchange for another technology. The app frontend has been built up with React.js. Take a look it!
